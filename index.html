		Hi! I'm Norbert and most of all I am a dad of a wonderful daughter and a husband, all thanks to my great wife. When I'm not doing that I am a software engineer in Onet which is an amazing company to work for. I grew up in Chicago, Illinois. When I was 11 I moved to Krak√≥w, Poland with my parents. I got into software development when I was 15, I started with c++ and moved on to full stack web development on every level I could think of. I like the dynamic ecosystem of tools and technologies in web development and actually enjoy trying out new tools every month. I embrace simplicity but at the same time I encourage myself to automate tasks that will actually make me more productive, so I can spend more time on the fun stuff. I guess that is it for now, when I find time I will add some pics and let you know what is going on.

		I did not make this website to show of my skills, I want to make this as simple as possible, no magic, nothing fancy. This is just to let you know who I am in a brief introduction.
